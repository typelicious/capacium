"""``cap doctor`` — verify installed capabilities have their runtimes available.

For every installed capability (or a specific one when given a spec), the doctor
command loads the manifest from the install path, computes the required runtimes
(declared + auto-inferred from ``mcp.command``), probes them with
``RuntimeResolver`` and prints a row per capability per runtime.

Exit code is decided by the caller (cli.py) based on the boolean return:
all green → True (exit 0), anything missing → False (exit 1).
