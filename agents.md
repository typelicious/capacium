# Capacium — Agents Guide

## Project Overview

Capacium is a Capability Packaging System for AI agent capabilities. It was extracted from SkillWeave's SWPM (SkillWeave Package Manager) and generalized from skill-only to multi-kind capability packaging.

## Naming Conventions

### Code
- Package: `capacium` (not `swpm`)
- CLI: `cap` (not `swpm`)
- Manifest: `capability.yaml` (not `.skillpkg.json`)
- Model: `Capability` (not `SkillPackage`)
- Kind: `Kind.SKILL`, `Kind.BUNDLE`, `Kind.TOOL`, `Kind.PROMPT`, `Kind.TEMPLATE`, `Kind.WORKFLOW`, `Kind.MCP_SERVER`, `Kind.CONNECTOR_PACK`

### Directory
- Config: `~/.capacium/`
- Cache: `~/.capacium/cache/`
- Active: `~/.capacium/active/`
- Registry: `~/.capacium/registry.db`

## Standards

### Python
- Target: 3.10+ (stdlib only for core)
- Style: PEP 8
- Types: Full annotations on all public APIs
- Testing: pytest with coverage

### Manifest (capability.yaml)
- Kind is required (one of: skill, bundle, tool, prompt, template, workflow, mcp-server, connector-pack)
- Version is required (semver: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Name is required (kebab-case recommended)
- Framework field declares target frameworks (optional, NULL = agnostic)
- Dependencies are version-constrained (semver range)
- Runtimes field (v0.7.0+) declares host-level runtime requirements
  (e.g. `uv: ">=0.4.0"`, `node: ">=20"`); validated pre-flight by `cap install`

### Releases
- Language requirement: All release notes and changelogs MUST be written in English.
- Naming convention: `Capacium vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `Capacium v1.0.0`, `Capacium v2.5.1`)
- `X.Y.Z` follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Git tags use the same format: `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Changelog entries reference the full name: `Capacium vX.Y.Z`
- Pre-release suffixes: `Capacium vX.Y.Z-alpha.N`, `Capacium vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, `Capacium vX.Y.Z-rc.N`

### Exit Codes
- 0: Success
- 1: User error (invalid input, missing args)
- 2: System error (I/O, database, network)

## Memory System

### progress.txt
- Updated per extraction/execution session
- Contains: what was done, technical decisions, next steps

### agents.md (this file)
- Project-specific patterns and conventions
- Updated when new patterns are established

## Bundle Support (Kind.BUNDLE)

- Bundle manifests define sub-capabilities in the `capabilities` section with `name` and `source`
- Validation ensures at least one capability entry, each with name and source
- Bundle fingerprint is computed from ordered fingerprints of all sub-capabilities (order-independent)
- Bundle member tracking via `bundle_members` table in the registry
- Bundle verification traverses all sub-cap fingerprints
- Reference counting prevents removal of sub-capabilities with active dependents
- `cap install` with bundle kind auto-registers all sub-cap members
- `cap remove --force` removes bundle and all sub-cap members

## Lock File System

- Lock files (`capability.lock`) pin exact versions and fingerprints of a capability and its dependencies
- `cap lock` generates a lock file for an installed capability
- `cap lock --update` refreshes an existing lock file
- `cap install --no-lock` bypasses lock file enforcement
- Lock enforcement checks: capability fingerprint, dependency versions, dependency fingerprints
- Lock files are serialized as YAML (preferred) or JSON (fallback)

## Multi-Repo Topology

Capacium is distributed across multiple public GitHub repos under the `Capacium` org. See `docs/repo-topology.md` for detailed dependency graph.

| Repo | Domain | Stack | CI |
|------|--------|-------|----|
| `Capacium/capacium` | Core CLI, manifest, packaging | Python (stdlib) | pytest |
| `Capacium/capacium-exchange` | Exchange API server | FastAPI / SQLAlchemy / PostgreSQL | pytest |
| `Capacium/capacium-crawler` | Agent network discovery crawler | Python (stdlib, urllib) | pytest |
| `Capacium/capacium-bridge` | WordPress plugin | PHP | — |
| `Capacium/homebrew-tap` | Homebrew formula | Ruby | test-bot |
| `Capacium/capacium-action-validate` | GitHub Action manifest validation | Composite action (YAML + Python) | pytest |
| `Capacium/capacium-github-app` | GitHub App webhook server | Python (stdlib, WSGI) | pytest |

### Dependency Direction
Core → Exchange → Crawler / Bridge (no reverse imports). Action and App depend on Core. Tap wraps Core binary.

### Key Integration Repos
- **capacium-action-validate**: GitHub Marketplace Action. Validates `capability.yaml` on CI: schema, fingerprint, linting. Outputs Exchange-ready metadata.
- **capacium-github-app**: GitHub App webhook server. Syncs repos to Exchange on push/release. Derives claim signals from installation context.

## Adapter System

- `FrameworkAdapter` ABC with `install_capability`, `remove_capability`, `capability_exists`
- Registered adapters: `opencode`, `claude-code`, `gemini-cli`
- Auto-selection via `get_adapter_for_manifest()` based on manifest `frameworks` field
- Falls back to `opencode` for unknown/empty frameworks
- Custom adapters can be registered via `register_adapter()`

## Runtimes (v0.7.0+)

- New `runtimes:` field on `capability.yaml` declares host-level requirements
  (`uv`, `node`, `python`, `docker`, `pipx`, `go`, `bun`, `deno`).
- Requirement syntax is intentionally minimal — `"*"`, `">=X.Y.Z"`, bare
  `"X.Y.Z"` (treated as `">=X.Y.Z"`). Stdlib-only comparator; no `packaging` /
  `semver` dependency.
- Auto-inference from `mcp.command` when `runtimes:` is omitted: `uvx` → `uv`,
  `npx` → `node`, `docker` → `docker`, `pipx` → `pipx`, `python(3)` → `python`,
  `bun(x)` → `bun`, `deno` → `deno`.
- `cap install` runs a pre-flight check; missing runtimes fail with exit code 1.
  `--skip-runtime-check` bypasses.
- `cap doctor` reports per-capability runtime health.
- `cap runtimes list` / `cap runtimes install <name>` inspect or print install
  hints (printing only — Capacium never executes package managers).
- All implementation lives in `src/capacium/runtimes.py` (resolver),
  `src/capacium/commands/doctor.py`, and
  `src/capacium/commands/runtimes_cmd.py`.
- The legacy `dependencies:` field is unchanged; it still expresses
  capability-on-capability deps. Runtimes are deliberately separate.

## V2 Exchange & Crawler Architecture

### Exchange Core
- Represents capabilities as `Listing` domain models with rich metadata.
- Managed via `ListingStore`, `PublisherStore`, `TaxonomyStore`, `CollectionStore`.
- Strict multi-dimensional Trust State Machine (`TrustMachine`):
  `discovered` → `indexed` → `claimed` → `verified` → `audited`.
- Faceted search SQL engine with semantic ranking (`ExchangeSearch`).
- Adds 11 new SQLite tables managed by standard migrations (`v2_exchange_crawler.py`).

### Crawler Subsystem
- Pipeline: Source (GitHub) → Fetch → Normalize → Classify → Dedup → Findings → Claim Prep.
- Uses purely stdlib for network (`urllib`) with automatic rate limit backoff.
- Can infer capability kind (`mcp-server`, `tool`, etc.) based on topics and names.
- Can promote valid findings directly into the Exchange as `discovered` listings.

### V2 CLI & API
- Native `cap exchange`, `cap crawl`, `cap trust`, `cap info`, `cap claim` commands.
- Expanded `cap search` with flags like `--category`, `--trust`, `--mcp-client`.
- REST API mounted at `/v2/` mapping CRUD+List operations directly to Exchange Core.

## Phase 1 Completion Status
