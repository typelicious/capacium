# Capacium — Agents Guide

## Project Overview

Capacium is a Capability Packaging System for AI agent capabilities. It was extracted from SkillWeave's SWPM (SkillWeave Package Manager) and generalized from skill-only to multi-kind capability packaging.

## Naming Conventions

### Code
- Package: `capacium` (not `swpm`)
- CLI: `cap` (not `swpm`)
- Manifest: `capability.yaml` (not `.skillpkg.json`)
- Model: `Capability` (not `SkillPackage`)
- Kind: `Kind.SKILL`, `Kind.BUNDLE`, `Kind.TOOL`, `Kind.PROMPT`, `Kind.TEMPLATE`, `Kind.WORKFLOW`

### Directory
- Config: `~/.capacium/`
- Cache: `~/.capacium/cache/`
- Active: `~/.capacium/active/`
- Registry: `~/.capacium/registry.db`

## CLI Commands

| Command | Function |
|---------|----------|
| `cap install` | Install capability from registry/path/git |
| `cap install --no-lock` | Install without lock file enforcement |
| `cap remove` | Remove installed capability |
| `cap list` | List installed capabilities |
| `cap list --kind` | Filter by kind (skill, bundle, tool, etc.) |
| `cap update` | Update capabilities |
| `cap search` | Search registry for capabilities |
| `cap search --kind` | Filter search results by kind |
| `cap search --registry` | Target a specific registry URL |
| `cap verify` | Verify capability fingerprint |
| `cap verify --all` | Verify all installed capabilities |
| `cap lock` | Generate capability.lock for an installed capability |
| `cap lock --update` | Refresh existing lock file |
| `cap package` | Package capability for distribution |
| `cap publish` | Publish capability to a registry (stub) |
| `cap publish --registry` | Target registry URL for publishing |

## Standards

### Python
- Target: 3.10+ (stdlib only for core)
- Style: PEP 8
- Types: Full annotations on all public APIs
- Testing: pytest with coverage

### Manifest (capability.yaml)
- Kind is required (one of: skill, bundle, tool, prompt, template, workflow)
- Version is required (semver: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Name is required (kebab-case recommended)
- Framework field declares target frameworks (optional, NULL = agnostic)
- Dependencies are version-constrained (semver range)

### Releases
- Naming convention: `Capacium vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `Capacium v1.0.0`, `Capacium v2.5.1`)
- `X.Y.Z` follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Git tags use the same format: `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- Changelog entries reference the full name: `Capacium vX.Y.Z`
- Pre-release suffixes: `Capacium vX.Y.Z-alpha.N`, `Capacium vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, `Capacium vX.Y.Z-rc.N`

### Exit Codes
- 0: Success
- 1: User error (invalid input, missing args)
- 2: System error (I/O, database, network)

## Memory System

### progress.txt
- Updated per extraction/execution session
- Contains: what was done, technical decisions, next steps

### agents.md (this file)
- Project-specific patterns and conventions
- Updated when new patterns are established

## Bundle Support (Kind.BUNDLE)

- Bundle manifests define sub-capabilities in the `capabilities` section with `name` and `source`
- Validation ensures at least one capability entry, each with name and source
- Bundle fingerprint is computed from ordered fingerprints of all sub-capabilities (order-independent)
- Bundle member tracking via `bundle_members` table in the registry
- Bundle verification traverses all sub-cap fingerprints
- Reference counting prevents removal of sub-capabilities with active dependents
- `cap install` with bundle kind auto-registers all sub-cap members
- `cap remove --force` removes bundle and all sub-cap members

## Lock File System

- Lock files (`capability.lock`) pin exact versions and fingerprints of a capability and its dependencies
- `cap lock` generates a lock file for an installed capability
- `cap lock --update` refreshes an existing lock file
- `cap install --no-lock` bypasses lock file enforcement
- Lock enforcement checks: capability fingerprint, dependency versions, dependency fingerprints
- Lock files are serialized as YAML (preferred) or JSON (fallback)

## Adapter System

- `FrameworkAdapter` ABC with `install_capability`, `remove_capability`, `capability_exists`
- Registered adapters: `opencode`, `claude-code`, `gemini-cli`
- Auto-selection via `get_adapter_for_manifest()` based on manifest `frameworks` field
- Falls back to `opencode` for unknown/empty frameworks
- Custom adapters can be registered via `register_adapter()`

## Phase 2 Completion Status

- **WS-BUNDLE** (complete): Bundle manifest validation, bundle fingerprint, registry operations, bundle member tracking
- **WS-ADAPTERS** (complete): Claude Code + Gemini CLI adapters, adapter auto-selection, custom adapter registry
- **WS-LOCK** (complete): Lock file generation, lock enforcement, dependency pinning, --no-lock bypass
- **WS-REGISTRY** (complete): OpenAPI spec, REST client (search, get, list_versions, download)
- **INTEGRATION** (complete): Cross-workstream tests, SkillWeave bundle structure, AGENTS.md updated
